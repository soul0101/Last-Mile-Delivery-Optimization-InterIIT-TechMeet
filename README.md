<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## **Introduction**
The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Pickup and Delivery (CVRPMPD) is a
optimization problem that involves finding the most effective routes while maintaining the various
constraints such as capacity, route lengths and route times. It is an NP-Hard problem whose time
complexity increases exponentially with increase in problem size and hence cannot be solved using
exact methods in a reasonable amount of time. 

The OR-Tools library along with innovative solutions are employed providing us with a robust, flexible and scalable solution.
