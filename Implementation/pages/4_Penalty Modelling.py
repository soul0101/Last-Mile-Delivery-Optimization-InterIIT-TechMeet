    An order in nearby areas with a high order density has a high priority value, as drivers delivering in
    nearby areas can piggyback this order, saving fuel and time and reducing trips. To include this factor, the
    city is divided into tiles based on Bangalore's ward data. 

    But, there might be cases where an order lies in a ward with a low order density but the neighbouring
    tiles have a very high order density. To overcome this problem each tile's priority is calculated by taking
    into consideration the priority of its neighbours' as well.
